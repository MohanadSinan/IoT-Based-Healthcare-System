# LM35 Temperature Sensor

## Description
The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit temperature devices with an output voltage linearly-proportional to the Centigrade temperature. The LM35 device has an advantage over	linear temperature sensors calibrated in Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a large	constant voltage from the output to obtain convenient Centigrade scaling. The LM35 device does not	require any external calibration or trimming to provide typical accuracies of ±¼°C at room	temperature and ±¾°C over a full −55°C to 150°C temperature range. Lower cost is assured by	trimming and calibration at the wafer level. The low-output impedance, linear output, and precise inherent calibration of the LM35 device makes interfacing to readout or control circuitry	especially easy. The device is used with single power supplies, or with plus and minus supplies. As	the LM35 device draws only 60 µA from the supply, it has very low self-heating of less than 0.1°C	in still air. The LM35 device is rated to operate over a −55°C to 150°C temperature range, while	the LM35C device is rated for a −40°C to 110°C range (−10° with improved accuracy). The LM35-series	devices are available packaged in hermetic TO transistor packages, while the LM35C, LM35CA, and	LM35D devices are available in the plastic TO-92 transistor package. The LM35D device is available	in an 8-lead surface-mount small-outline package and a plastic TO-220 package.
